        <h1>WRO 2015</h1>
        <p>The World Robot Olympiad is a global robotics competition for young people. First held in 2004 in Singapore, it now attracts more than 20,000 teams from nearly 60 countries. The competition consists of 4 categories: Regular, College, Open and Soccer. Regular and Open categories consist of three age groups: Elementary, Junior High and Senior High. It is based on the idea that students from all over the world should have the opportunity to meet with other students to develop creativity, design and problem solving skills through challenging and educational robot competitions and activities.

        <p>The 2015 Regular Junior High challenge 'Treasure Hunt' required a robot to autonomously navigate around an unknown region finding and collecting good artefacts while staying safe and away from the invalid artefacts. Our robot solved the coordinate system with its wonderful sense of coordinates and direction, and ended back in the start area earning full points.

        <h1>WRO 2016</h1>
        <p>The World Robot Olympiad is a global robotics competition for young people. The 2016 season, Rap the Scrap, is to be held in Delhi, India in November 2016. The Indian chapter began from October, with the Delhi-NCR Regionals being the opening tournament of the season. This year saw an immense increase in the number of teams, trying to figure out a way of solving a much more complex challenge- Waste Sorting. 

        <p>The 2016 Regular Junior High challenge 'Waste Sorting' requires a robot to autonomously identify and locate the different types of wastes (denoted by cubes of different sizes and colours) found inside the house, and take them to their respective bins, to sort the waste. The challenge requires locating the different bins available for sorting (also differentiated by colors, and location), identifying different wastes available, and matching the wastes to their respective bins using an algorithm. Finally, to score points, the robot needs to pick the wastes, deposit them in the bins, and return to the start area (the house).
